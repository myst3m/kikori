# Use BME280

Last updated: 2018-09-16 17:30

If you want to use BME280 sensor, you can use built-in driver and config as below.
You can change name and address as you like, 

```clojure
(with-first-device
    (place :I2C {:addr 0x76 :name "BME0" :module :BME280})
    (ready!)
```    

Full code to run with built-in web server is as below.
```clojure
(ns bme280-sample
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [read])
  (:require [kikori.core :as k]))

(k/refer-kikori)
(set-log-level! :warn)

(load-module "bme280")

(defn register-device []
  (with-first-device
    (config :I2C)
    (place :I2C {:addr 0x76 :name "BME0" :module :BME280})
    (ready!)))

(register-device)
(srv/start-web-server :ip "0.0.0.0" :port 3000)

```    

Save to file (here, bme280-sample.clj) and run as below.
(It is necessary to change jar file to the name you are using)

```sh
$ kikori -cp target/kikori-0.6-SNAPSHOT.jar run bme280-sample.clj
```

And access HTTP/GET or WebSockets descrived in README.md

If you cannot see the device, please check if the I2C address is correct.
And you can change the log level to :debug that is specified by __set-log-level!__.
